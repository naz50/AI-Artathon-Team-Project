Inspiration
Dalah (coffee pot) is a distinctive symbol that represents the Arab bedouin civilization, especially the Saudi civilization, a guide that expresses its interior and appearance with our original Bedouins. It is the meaning of cohesion and societal strength. We gathered "Dalah" with art in Islamic Arabic inscriptions and calligraphy to generate a new distinctive pattern.
